# Notes
Here is a link to the <a href="README.md">README.md</a>.

These are notes that can be used on midterms and the final exam. This file can be modified through the entire class. Other .md files can be added and linked here to help things be more organized.

## Git and GitHub
Git provides two valuable functions:
- First, it allows you to track versions of files in a directory. 
- Second, it allows you to clone all of those versions to a different location, usually to a different computer.

Helful git commands:

Commit SHA:
- Every commit has a unique identifier that is generated by hashing the file along with the timestamp using the SHA hashing algorithm. You can always refer to a specific commit in your version history by using its SHA.

Branches:
- Allows you to work on variations of the code while still allowing progress on the main branch.
*** For the future, ask if images and gifs can be added to the notes.md or if it is text only. ***

Creating files and adding them to the repository after you've cloned from GitHub:
```
git add file.filetype
git commit -am "really great commit message here"
git push
```
