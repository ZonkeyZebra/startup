# Notes
Here is a link to the <a href="README.md">README.md</a>.

These are notes that can be used on midterms and the final exam. This file can be modified through the entire class. Other .md files can be added and linked here to help things be more organized.

## Git and GitHub
Git provides two valuable functions:
- First, it allows you to track versions of files in a directory. 
- Second, it allows you to clone all of those versions to a different location, usually to a different computer.

**Helful commands:**
- `echo` output the parameters of the command
- `cd` change directory
- `mkdir` make directory
- `rmdir` remove directory
- `rm` remove file(s)
- `mv` move file(s)
- `cp` copy files
- `ls` list files
- `curl` command line client URL browser
- `grep` regular expression search
- `find` find files
- `top` view running processes
- `df` view disk statistics
- `cat` output file
- `less` interactive file output
- `wc` count words
- `ps` view processes
- `kill` kill a process
- `sudo` execute as a admin
- `ssh` remote shell
- `scp` securely copy files to a remote computer
- `history` show history of commands
- `ping` test connection
- `tracert` trace network
- `dig` DNS info
- `man` look in the manual to find out how a command works
```
git clone {repository URL}
git commit -am "message"
git pull
git push
git add
git init
git diff {HEAD HEAD~1}
```

**Commit SHA:**
- Every commit has a unique identifier that is generated by hashing the file along with the timestamp using the SHA hashing algorithm. You can always refer to a specific commit in your version history by using its SHA.

**Branches:**
- Allows you to work on variations of the code while still allowing progress on the main branch.
*** For the future, ask if images and gifs can be added to the notes.md or if it is text only. ***

**Creating files and adding them to the repository after you've cloned from GitHub:**
```
git add file.filetype
git commit -am "really great commit message here"
git push
```
**Basic development process:**
1. Pull the repository's latest changes from GitHub (git pull)
1. Make edits
1. Commit the changes (git commit)
1. Push the changes to GitHub (git push)

*Remember to commit often and with good comments!*

**Merges:**
```
git fetch
git status
Your branch and 'origin/main' have diverged,
and have 1 and 1 different commits each, respectively.
  (use "git pull" to merge the remote branch into yours)
```
This shows there is a conflict that needs to be merged since Git doesn't know which commit to keep.
```
git pull
Auto-merging test.md
CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in test.md
Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.
```
Once you find the conflict, pick which one to keep and modify teh file to keep the wanted changes. Then commit and push again.
```
git commit -am "awsome comment about the merge"
git push
```

**Forks:**
- A GitHub fork provides the ability to create a copy of a GitHub repository.
- Usually you fork a repo to get a copy of an open source code base that you want to experiment with, or contribute to.
- A fork is similar to cloning a repository to your development environment, but it clones to GitHub instead.
- Pull a fork down to your development environment to work on it.
- A fork also allows you to create a pull request in order to push suggested changes to the original repository.
